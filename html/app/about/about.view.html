            <h3>Collage is a technique of an art production, primarily used in the visual arts, where the artwork is
                made from an assemblage of different forms, thus creating a new whole. A collage includes Photographs
                glued to a piece of paper or canvas. The origins of collage can be traced back hundreds of years, but
                this technique made a dramatic reappearance in the early 20th century as an art form of novelty.</h3>
